				<div class="answer non-active">
					<p>We’ll start with a complimentary 15-minute video consultation. If it is a mutual fit, we’ll set up an initial appointment. During this session, I’ll ask you more detailed questions in order to get to know you better. We will create a treatment plan that’s tailored to you and what you are looking to get out of therapy. We will then meet at a mutually agreed upon frequency (typically weekly) to work toward your goals.</p>

					What can I expect from my consultation?

						<i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i>
					</span>
				</div>
				<div class="answer non-active">
                    <p>Consultations are 15 minutes and are held over video. This allows us to see if we might be a good fit for each other, and gives you the opportunity to ask any questions you may have. We will also talk about what you hope to get out of therapy, and logistics such as billing and scheduling.</p>

				<div class="question">
					How long and how often is therapy?
					<span class="icon-main">
						<i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i>
					</span>
				</div>
				<div class="answer non-active">
                    <p>Therapy sessions are typically 45 minutes long. Therapy yields the most consistent results when attended on a weekly basis. It is an ongoing process and there may be times where you will need to be seen more or less frequently.</p>
					<p>There are no rules for how long you <em>should</em> be in therapy for. Some clients come to therapy short-term to resolve a specific issue and others remain in therapy for years for continued support and growth. We will work together to determine when your therapeutic goals have been met.</p>

				<div class="answer non-active">
                    <p>Virtual therapy offers a convenient and flexible option for receiving therapy from the comfort of your own home or any other location that works for you. With virtual therapy, there's no need to deal with the stress and hassle of commuting to appointments, and it makes it easier to fit therapy into your busy schedule. We conduct virtual appointments through a secure video platform that's accessible via our client portal, providing you with a confidential and private setting to receive the support and care you need.</p>

                    <p>Mollie Spiesman LCSW PLLC is considered an out-of-network provider with all insurances. As an out-of-network provider, we are committed to helping you receive the maximum benefits available through your out-of-network mental health coverage.

                    <p>Mollie Spiesman LCSW PLLC operates as an out-of-network therapy practice. By not accepting insurance directly, we are able to focus solely on serving our clients. If we were to accept insurance, we would be subject to their regulations, including the possibility of limited coverage and less privacy in regards to personal health information. As an out-of-network provider, we are committed to working directly with you, with greater flexibility and confidentiality in our approach to therapy.</p>
